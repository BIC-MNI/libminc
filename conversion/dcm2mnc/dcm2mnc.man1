.SH NAME

.B dcm2mnc
- convert sets of DICOM files to one or more MINC format files.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B dcm2mnc 
.I [<options>] <input-list> <output-dir>

.B dcm2mnc 
.I -help

.SH DESCRIPTION

The 
.B dcm2mnc 
command is used to convert DICOM format files to MINC format.

DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format is used by
many vendors of medical imaging equipment as a standard means of data
interchange.  The DICOM specification is extremely complex and includes
protocols for data interchange and communications as well as the
specifics of the data format.  In most cases, tens or even hundreds of
DICOM files must be combined to produce a single MINC file.

In normal operation, the 
.I input-list 
will consist of the names of one or more files or directories.
The program scans all specified input files and
directories and attempts to identify groups of files that should be
combined into a single MINC file.  Once these groups (or "series") of
DICOM files are identified, the program analyzes the data for each
series and attempts to determine the correct geometry and ancillary
information to be incorporated into the MINC file.

If all goes well, one or more MINC files will be created in one or 
more subdirectories created in the specified directory
.IR output-dir .
These directories and files will be automatically named according to the
patient's name, the acquisition date, acquisition time, series
identifier, and modality.

For a variety of reasons, medical imaging manufacturers have chosen to
implement a number of proprietary extensions to the DICOM format. This
program attempts to be very general, but it does some extra
checking for specific proprietary fields where useful or
necessary. However, as device settings change and software is updated,
the precise details of the DICOM output for a given device may shift.
Different devices from the same manufacturer may produce substantially
different DICOM output.

.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as they
are unique) and can be given anywhere on the command line.

.SH "Output file options"
.TP
.BI -clobber
Overwrite existing files.  By default,
.B dcm2mnc
will not write over an existing file.

.TP
.BI -anon
Do not store the patient name in the MINC file.  The string "anonymous"
will be used instead.  Note that all other identifying information will
still be stored in the file.

.TP
.BI -nosplitecho
Do not split echoes into separate files.  If multiple echoes are present
in a series, they will all be stored in a single MINC file with a
dimension named "echo".

.TP
.BI -splitdynamic
Split dynamic scans into separate files. Normally dynamic scans are
stored in a single MINC file with a "time" dimension.  If this option is
specified, each time slice will be saved in a separate file.

.SH "Siemens mosaic specific options"
These two options control the manner in which Siemens mosaic data is 
converted.  Siemens scanners commonly represent fMRI data as a "mosaic"
of subimages combined into a single large image.  Normally these are in
what we call "ascending" order, but if your functional image is not 
converted properly, you may need to specify one of these options.
NOTE that the mosaic order is often not the same as the slice
acquisition order.

.TP
.BI -descending
The mosaic image is stored in descending order.
.TP
.BI -interleaved
The mosaic image is stored in alternating (odd/even) order.

.SH "Other options"

.TP
.BI -stdin
This option tells
.B dcm2mnc
to read a list of input files from the standard input in addition to any
files specified on the command line.

.TP
.BI -cmd " <string>"
This option will apply the given command string to each output file
after it is created.  Can be used to run gzip or compress on each output
file, for example.

.TP
.BI -minmax

Use the values for the largest and smallest pixel value as stored in the
DICOM file. This is useful especially with GE PET data, but may be
needed to get a quantitatively accurate conversion with other
manufacturers.  If this option is not specified.  .B dcm2mnc uses the
full range of the datatype as specified by the number of bits stored per
voxel (field # 0028,0101).  When this option is specified, the 0028,0106
and 0028,0107 will be used to set the valid range of pixels.

.TP
.BI -list
List files in series, but do not perform conversion.  Sometimes useful
for verifying the validity of a dataset, and for debugging problems with
.BR dcm2mnc .

.TP
.BI -verbose
Verbose operation.  Prints a large amount of additional information
about the program's operation. This information can probably only be 
interpreted by someone familiar with both this program and the DICOM standard.

.TP
.BI -debug
Extremely verbose operation.  Prints a huge amount of additional information
about the program's operation. This information can probably only be 
interpreted by someone familiar with both this program and the DICOM standard.

.TP
.BI -opts " <value>"
This is a private option intended only for debugging purposes.  Please
avoid using it.

.SH "Generic options for all commands"
.TP 	
.BI -help
Print summary of command\-line options and abort
.TP
.BI -version
Print the program and library versions and abort

.SH BUGS

Probably many. For best results, output files should be checked by a
compenent human to verify that the conversion was performed properly.
DICOM is a very complex format, and it is difficult to anticipate all of
the possible combinations of fields and values that may be encountered.
If you have a problem, please contact the maintainer.  It will be
extremely useful if you can provide an example dataset that exhibits the
problem you have discovered.
