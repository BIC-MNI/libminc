.SH NAME

.B nii2mnc
- convert a NIfTI-1 or Analyze 7.5 format file to a MINC format file.

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B nii2mnc 
.I [<options>] <infile> <outfile.mnc>

.B nii2mnc 
.I -help

.SH DESCRIPTION

The 
.B nii2mnc 
command is used to convert "NIfTI-1" format files to MINC format.  The
NIfTI-1 format was developed by the members of the Neuroinformatics
Technology Initiative's Data Format Working Group (DFWG).  The NIfTI-1
format is based upon the Mayo Clinic's Analyze 7.5 format.

The name of the program is derived from the common filename suffixes
used for NIfTI-1 and MINC files.  NIfTI-1 defines two possible formats, a
"header plus raw image" 2-file format, and a single-file format that
includes both header information and the image data.  As with Analyze
7.5, the 2-file format consists of one file with the suffix ".hdr" and
another file with the extension ".img".  In NIfTI-1 single-file format,
the two files may be combined into a single file with a ".nii" filename
suffix.

.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as they
are unique) and can be given anywhere on the command line.

these fields.
